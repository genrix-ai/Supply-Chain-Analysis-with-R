This Supply Chain Analysis project uses R programming to optimize and analyze supply chain operations by leveraging data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory analysis to uncover key insights, such as cost-saving opportunities, demand patterns, and process inefficiencies. The insights derived help businesses streamline their processes and improve decision-making for a more efficient supply chain.

**About Dataset**  
The analysis utilized a dataset from DataCo Global's supply chains. This dataset enables the application of machine learning algorithms and R software for deriving insights. Key areas covered include provisioning, production, sales, and commercial distribution, allowing for the correlation of structured and unstructured data to generate valuable knowledge.  

- **Data Types:**  
  - *Structured Data:* `DataCoSupplyChainDataset.csv`
