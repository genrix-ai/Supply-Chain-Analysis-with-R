This Supply Chain Analysis project uses R programming to optimize and analyze supply chain operations by leveraging data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory analysis to uncover key insights, such as cost-saving opportunities, demand patterns, and process inefficiencies. The insights derived help businesses streamline their processes and improve decision-making for a more efficient supply chain.
